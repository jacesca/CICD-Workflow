    "In this chapter, you'll explore the integration of machine learning model training into a GitHub Action pipeline using Continuous Machine Learning GitHub Action. You'll generate a comprehensive markdown report including model metrics and plots. You will also delve into data versioning in Machine Learning by adopting Data Version Control (DVC) to track data changes. The chapter also covers setting DVC remotes and dataset transfers. Finally, you'll explore DVC pipelines, configuring a DVC YAML file to orchestrate reproducible model training."
